# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math function
### Step 2: 
Assign the values of x1,y1 and x2,y2 whose distance is to be calculated
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the values to get the answer
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
 ```

import math
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
result=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(result))

```
